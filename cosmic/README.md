# Ringboard COSMIC Desktop

This application offers both a normal libcosmic Ringboard implementation along with a COSMIC Desktop applet.

## Translators

[Fluent](https://projectfluent.org/) is used for localization. Fluent's translation files are found
in the [i18n directory](./i18n). New translations may copy the
[English (en) localization](./i18n/en) of the project, rename `en` to the desired
[ISO 639-1 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes), and then
translations can be provided for each
[message identifier](https://projectfluent.org/fluent/guide/hello.html). If no translation is
necessary, the message may be omitted.
