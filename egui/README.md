# Ringboard egui

<a href="https://crates.io/crates/clipboard-history-egui">![Crates.io Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/clipboard-history-egui)</a>

This binary is a Ringboard client that provides a GUI built with
[egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui).

## Suggested workflow

To reduce startup latency, closing the application sends it to the background rather than killing
it. Thus, it is suggested to bind a shortcut that executes the following command for fast clipboard
launches:

```shell
# Run this command to generate the command that goes in the shortcut
bash -c 'echo $(which ringboard-egui) toggle'
```
